- Make your gameplay more natural up to your liking!

LunarView's game optimalization provides you with an excellent & reliable system to optimize your gameplay based on your range of requested settings.

## How does LunarView optimize your game?

Auto-applied:
- Detects and deletes unused objects
- Prevents unwanted error and warning spam waves in console, which affects your gameplay at some little point
- Temporarily deletes every asset that is out of your FOV

User-appliable:
- Softlock render distance up to a specific stud value
- Remove non-collidable objects (If they're truly just a decoration)
- Texture removal
- Particle removal

LunarView's efficient and optimized engine also supports community-created extensions.

## How does LunarView run extensions? 

- The community creates extensions which are verified and checked by our developer team incase of an explicit injection.
- Specific & official extensions are automatically applied in specific games, yet you can still turn them off.

## Developer support & built-in terminal

- Users can also use commands in order to set configs faster.
- Terminal supports a custom command language, which is really easy to understand.
- Abusing the terminal is not possible, it was designed precisely enough to prevent users from injecting malicious content.
- The terminal is strongly intertwined between the tool, meaning user data is shared between the tool & the terminal.

## Potential risks

- Users could get banned for changing settings, reason is that some experiences flag this as a potential cheat injection
- Users could experience data loss, game crashes and more
- Users will experience instant game glitches and LunarView data corruption once injecting a command table with errors (Error debugging not implemented yet)

# Use at your own risk, games stated before have a guaranteed experience without bugs, potential bans and more unpleasant moments.

# Remaking, reuploading and more plagiarist movements are prohibited as that would be flagged as infringing content, as the LunarView tool is rightfully owned and ran by LunarView and it's contributors.
